# Analyzing Loan Restructuring Impact with NPV in Streamlit

## 1. Introduction and Application Overview
Duration: 0:05

Welcome to this codelab, where we will explore a powerful Streamlit application designed to analyze the economic impact of loan restructuring using Net Present Value (NPV) models. This application provides a transparent and auditable framework to quantify the financial gain or loss from restructuring through a deterministic NPV modeling approach.

### The Importance of Loan Restructuring Analysis

Loan restructuring is a critical financial operation for institutions. It involves modifying the terms of an existing loan, often to help a borrower facing financial difficulties or to optimize portfolio performance under changing market conditions. Accurately assessing the financial implications of such changes is paramount for:

*   **Risk Management:** Quantifying potential losses or gains from altered loan terms to mitigate risks.
*   **Strategic Decision Making:** Guiding decisions on whether to restructure a loan and under what specific terms.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** Providing a robust, auditable framework for valuing restructured assets, which is often required by financial regulators.
*   **Portfolio Optimization:** Identifying which loans, when restructured, can yield the most significant positive impact on the institution's financial health.

This application simplifies this complex analysis by providing an intuitive user interface built with Streamlit and a robust backend powered by Python's data science libraries.

### Core Financial Concepts

The application centers around the following fundamental financial concepts:

1.  **Net Present Value (NPV):** NPV is a widely used financial metric to evaluate the profitability of an investment or project. It measures the difference between the present value of expected cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a specified period. The fundamental formula for Net Present Value (NPV) is:
    $$
    NPV = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}
    $$
    Where:
    *   $CF_t$ represents the cash flow (interest plus principal payments) at time $t$.
    *   $t$ is the time period in which the cash flow occurs (e.g., month, quarter, year).
    *   $r$ is the discount rate per period, reflecting the time value of money and the risk associated with the cash flows.
    *   $T$ is the total number of time periods over which cash flows are projected.

2.  **Economic Gain/Loss ($\Delta NPV$):** The economic impact of a loan restructuring is measured by comparing the NPV of the loan under its original terms ($NPV_{orig}$) to its NPV under the new, restructured terms ($NPV_{new}$). The change is calculated as:
    $$
    \Delta NPV = NPV_{new} - NPV_{orig}
    $$
    *   A **positive $\Delta NPV$** indicates an economic gain for the lender, meaning the present value of the new cash flows is higher than the original.
    *   A **negative $\Delta NPV$** indicates an economic loss for the lender, meaning the present value of the new cash flows is lower than the original.

3.  **Discount Rate Determination:** The choice of the discount rate $r$ is crucial as it directly impacts the calculated NPV. It typically reflects the cost of capital, a risk-free rate, and a credit spread commensurate with the borrower's credit risk. For restructured loans, the new discount rate might also reflect changes in perceived risk or market conditions:
    $$
    r_{new} = r_{orig} + \text{Credit Spread Adjustment}
    $$

### Application Architecture and Data Flow

The application is structured into several Python files, each serving a specific purpose, demonstrating good modular programming practices:

*   `app.py`: The main entry point for the Streamlit application. It initializes `st.session_state` to persist data across different pages and handles navigation. It also presents the initial introduction.
*   `application_pages/page1.py`: Manages the data generation and initial pre-processing steps.
*   `application_pages/page2.py`: Focuses on the core NPV calculations and sensitivity analysis.
*   `application_pages/page3.py`: Responsible for visualizing the analysis results.
*   `application_pages/utils.py`: Contains utility functions for generating synthetic loan data, calculating amortization schedules, expanding cash flows, calculating discount rates, and merging data.
*   `application_pages/plots.py`: Contains functions for plotting various visualizations (cash flow timelines, waterfall charts, loan-level analysis) and the fundamental `calculate_npv` function.

The data flows through the application in a sequential manner:

1.  **Data Generation (`page1.py`, `utils.py`):** Synthetic loan data is created, including original and (if applicable) restructured loan terms.
2.  **Cash Flow Expansion (`page1.py`, `utils.py`):** Detailed amortization schedules and cash flow streams are generated for both original and new loan scenarios.
3.  **Discount Rate Calculation (`page1.py`, `utils.py`):** Appropriate discount rates are determined for each loan based on factors like credit score.
4.  **Data Consolidation (`page1.py`, `utils.py`):** All relevant loan and cash flow data is merged into a "master" DataFrame for analysis.
5.  **NPV Calculation (`page2.py`, `plots.py`):** The Net Present Value is computed for both original and new scenarios for each loan, and the $\Delta NPV$ is derived.
6.  **Sensitivity Analysis (`page2.py`, `plots.py`):** The impact of changes in discount rates on NPV outcomes is assessed.
7.  **Visualization (`page3.py`, `plots.py`):** Results are presented through interactive charts for comprehensive insights.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Key Concept: `st.session_state`</b>. This application heavily uses `st.session_state` to store and pass data between different pages and rerun instances of the Streamlit application without losing the computed results. This is a crucial feature for building multi-page, interactive Streamlit apps where data needs to persist.
</aside>

## 2. Data Generation and Pre-processing
Duration: 0:10

This step focuses on creating the foundational dataset that simulates a loan portfolio, which is essential for any financial analysis. We will generate synthetic loan data and then process it to create detailed cash flow schedules for both original and restructured scenarios.

### Navigating to the Page

To start, open the Streamlit application. In the sidebar, select **"Data Generation"** from the **Navigation** dropdown.

### Generating Synthetic Loan Data

The application begins by simulating a diverse loan portfolio. This is crucial for building and validating analytical models in a controlled environment.

The `generate_enhanced_loan_data_adaptable` function in `application_pages/utils.py` is responsible for this. It creates a `pandas.DataFrame` with various loan attributes such as:

*   `loan_id`: Unique identifier for each loan.
*   `issuance_date`: The date the loan was originated.
*   `original_amount`: The initial principal amount of the loan.
*   `original_term_mths`: Original loan term in months.
*   `original_rate`: Original annual interest rate.
*   `credit_score`: Borrower's credit score, influencing discount rates.
*   `collateral_value`: Value of the collateral securing the loan.
*   `loan_type`: e.g., Mortgage, Auto, Personal, Business.
*   `region`: Geographical region of the loan.
*   `is_restructured`: Boolean flag indicating if the loan was restructured.
*   `restructure_date`: Date of restructuring (if applicable).
*   `new_term_mths`: New term after restructuring (if applicable).
*   `new_rate`: New rate after restructuring (if applicable).
*   `restructure_reason`: Reason for restructuring (if applicable).

<aside class="positive">
The `generate_enhanced_loan_data_adaptable` function includes logic to randomly select a percentage of loans to be restructured and assigns new terms and rates to them, making the dataset more realistic for our analysis.
</aside>

**Code Snippet (`application_pages/utils.py`):**
```python
def generate_enhanced_loan_data_adaptable(num_loans_param):
    """
    Generate enhanced synthetic loan data with more realistic and diverse scenarios.
    Modified to accept num_loans_param.
    """
    data = []
    num_loans = num_loans_param
    # ... (rest of the data generation logic)
    return data
```

**Streamlit Interaction:**
On the "Data Generation" page, you will see an input field **"Number of Loans to Generate"**.
1.  Enter your desired number of loans (e.g., `25`).
2.  Click the **"Generate & Process Loan Data"** button.

### Expanding Cash Flows

Once the initial loan data is generated, the next crucial step is to expand these loans into detailed cash flow schedules. This involves calculating the principal and interest payments for each period over the loan's term.

The `expand_cashflows` function in `application_pages/utils.py` orchestrates this. It uses the helper function `_calculate_amortization_schedule` to generate the payment details for both the original and, if applicable, the new (restructured) loan terms.

**Code Snippet (`application_pages/utils.py`):**
```python
def _calculate_amortization_schedule(loan_id, principal_amount, annual_rate, term_mths, pay_freq, start_date):
    """Calculates the amortization schedule for a single loan."""
    # ... (amortization calculation logic)
    return pd.DataFrame(schedule)

def expand_cashflows(df_loans):
    """Expands original and new loan terms into detailed cash flow schedules."""
    all_cf_orig = []
    all_cf_new = []
    for _, row in df_loans.iterrows():
        # Original Loan Cash Flows
        orig_schedule = _calculate_amortization_schedule(
            row["loan_id"], row["original_amount"], row["original_rate"],
            row["original_term_mths"], row["original_payment_freq"], row["issuance_date"]
        )
        # ... (logic for new cash flows if restructured)
    return cf_orig_df, cf_new_df
```

### Calculating Discount Rates

For NPV calculation, each loan needs an appropriate discount rate. The `calc_discount_rate` function in `application_pages/utils.py` assigns a simplified discount rate to each loan based on its `credit_score`. It also adjusts the new discount rate for restructured loans, reflecting potential changes in risk or terms.

**Code Snippet (`application_pages/utils.py`):**
```python
def calc_discount_rate(df_loans):
    """Calculates effective discount rates for original and new scenarios based on credit score."""
    base_rate = 0.04 # Example base rate
    def get_credit_spread(score):
        # ... (logic to determine spread based on score)
    df_loans["original_discount_rate"] = df_loans.apply(lambda row: base_rate + get_credit_spread(row["credit_score"]), axis=1)
    df_loans["new_discount_rate"] = df_loans.apply(
        lambda row: (base_rate + get_credit_spread(row["credit_score"]) + (row["new_rate"] - row["original_rate"])
                     if row["is_restructured"] else row["original_discount_rate"]),
        axis=1
    )
    return df_loans
```

### Tidying and Merging Data

Finally, the `tidy_merge` function in `application_pages/utils.py` combines the generated loan data (with discount rates) and the expanded cash flow schedules into a single master DataFrame. This consolidated DataFrame, `loan_cf_master_enhanced`, is then ready for NPV calculations.

**Streamlit Interaction:**
After clicking "Generate & Process Loan Data", you will see previews of the **"Generated Loan Data Preview"** and **"Tidied Cash Flow Master Data Preview"** DataFrames. You can also download the master DataFrame as a Parquet file using the **"Download loan_cf_master.parquet"** button.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Caching Data:</b> Notice the `@st.cache_data` decorator used in `page1.py`. This decorator tells Streamlit to cache the results of these functions. If the input parameters to the function don't change, Streamlit will use the cached result instead of re-running the function, significantly speeding up the application. This is particularly useful for computationally intensive data generation and processing steps.
</aside>

## 3. NPV Calculation Engine
Duration: 0:15

This step is the heart of the application, where the core Net Present Value (NPV) calculations are performed for both original and restructured loan scenarios. We will also explore how to conduct sensitivity analysis on these results.

### Navigating to the Page

In the Streamlit sidebar, select **"NPV Analysis"** from the **Navigation** dropdown.

### The Core `calculate_npv` Function

The fundamental NPV calculation is encapsulated in the `calculate_npv` function within `application_pages/plots.py`. This function takes a series of cash flows and a discount rate, then applies the NPV formula.

<aside class="positive">
Recall the NPV formula: $$NPV = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}$$. This function directly implements this formula, iterating through each cash flow $CF_t$ at time $t$ and discounting it by $(1+r)^t$.
</aside>

**Code Snippet (`application_pages/plots.py`):**
```python
def calculate_npv(cashflows, discount_rate):
    """
    Calculates the Net Present Value (NPV) given a series of cash flows and a discount rate.
    Assumes cashflows are a Series where index is time period (e.g., 1, 2, 3...) and values are cash amounts.
    """
    if cashflows.empty:
        return 0.0
    
    cashflows = pd.to_numeric(cashflows)
    
    pv_sum = 0
    for t, cf_t in cashflows.items(): # Iterate through index (t) and value (cf_t)
        pv_sum += cf_t / ((1 + discount_rate)**t)
    return pv_sum
```

### Running the NPV Analysis

The `run_npv_analysis_adaptable` function in `application_pages/plots.py` orchestrates the application of the `calculate_npv` function across all loans in our master cash flow DataFrame. For each loan, it performs the following:

1.  Retrieves the original and new discount rates previously calculated.
2.  Extracts the original and new cash flow series.
3.  Calculates `NPV_orig` using the original cash flows and discount rate.
4.  Calculates `NPV_new` using the new cash flows and new discount rate.
5.  Computes `Delta_NPV` as $NPV_{new} - NPV_{orig}$.
6.  Determines if the `Delta_NPV` is "material" based on a user-defined threshold.

**Code Snippet (`application_pages/plots.py`):**
```python
def run_npv_analysis_adaptable(df_master: pd.DataFrame, MATERIALITY_THRESHOLD: float) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Orchestrates the NPV calculation for all loans in the master cash flow dataframe.
    Computes NPV_orig, NPV_new, Delta_NPV, and a materiality flag.
    """
    if df_master.empty:
        return pd.DataFrame()

    npv_results = []
    for loan_id in df_master['loan_id'].unique():
        loan_data = df_master[df_master['loan_id'] == loan_id].copy()
        orig_rate = loan_data['original_discount_rate'].iloc[0]
        new_rate = loan_data['new_discount_rate'].iloc[0]
        
        cf_orig = loan_data[loan_data['scenario'] == 'Original'].set_index('payment_number')['total_payment']
        cf_new = loan_data[loan_data['scenario'] == 'New'].set_index('payment_number')['total_payment']
        
        npv_orig = calculate_npv(cf_orig, orig_rate)
        npv_new = calculate_npv(cf_new, new_rate)
        
        delta_npv = npv_new - npv_orig
        is_material = abs(delta_npv) > MATERIALITY_THRESHOLD

        npv_results.append({
            'loan_id': loan_id, 'NPV_orig': npv_orig, 'NPV_new': npv_new,
            'Delta_NPV': delta_npv, 'material': is_material
        })
    return pd.DataFrame(npv_results)
```

**Streamlit Interaction:**
1.  Ensure you have generated loan data from the "Data Generation" page first.
2.  On the "NPV Analysis" page, set the **"Materiality Threshold ($)"**. This value defines what constitutes a "material" change in NPV for a loan.
3.  Click the **"Run NPV Analysis"** button.
4.  The results will be displayed in a DataFrame under **"NPV Analysis Results"**. You can also download these results.

### Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis is a crucial technique in financial modeling to understand how the output of a model changes when input variables are varied. Here, we analyze the impact of changes in the discount rate on the NPV outcomes.

The `run_sensitivity` function in `application_pages/plots.py` performs this analysis. It takes the `df_master` (cash flow data) and a `rate_shift_bp` (rate shift in basis points) as input.

For each loan, it calculates new, shifted discount rates for both the original ($r_{orig, shifted}$) and new ($r_{new, shifted}$) scenarios:
$$
r_{orig, shifted} = r_{orig} + \text{rate\_shift\_decimal}
$$
$$
r_{new, shifted} = r_{new} + \text{rate\_shift\_decimal}
$$
Where $\text{rate\_shift\_decimal} = \text{rate\_shift\_bp} / 10000.0$.
It then recalculates the NPVs and $\Delta NPV$ using these shifted rates.

**Code Snippet (`application_pages/plots.py`):**
```python
def run_sensitivity(df_master: pd.DataFrame, rate_shift_bp: int) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Performs sensitivity analysis on NPV by shifting discount rates.
    rate_shift_bp: integer, basis points to shift the discount rate (e.g., 50 for +50bp, -100 for -100bp).
    """
    if df_master.empty:
        return pd.DataFrame()

    rate_shift_decimal = rate_shift_bp / 10000.0
    sensitivity_results = []

    for loan_id in df_master['loan_id'].unique():
        loan_data = df_master[df_master['loan_id'] == loan_id].copy()
        orig_rate_base = loan_data['original_discount_rate'].iloc[0]
        new_rate_base = loan_data['new_discount_rate'].iloc[0]

        orig_rate_shifted = orig_rate_base + rate_shift_decimal
        new_rate_shifted = new_rate_base + rate_shift_decimal

        cf_orig = loan_data[loan_data['scenario'] == 'Original'].set_index('payment_number')['total_payment']
        cf_new = loan_data[loan_data['scenario'] == 'New'].set_index('payment_number')['total_payment']

        npv_orig_shifted = calculate_npv(cf_orig, orig_rate_shifted)
        npv_new_shifted = calculate_npv(cf_new, new_rate_shifted)
        delta_npv_shifted = npv_new_shifted - npv_orig_shifted

        sensitivity_results.append({
            'loan_id': loan_id, 'Original_Rate_Shifted': orig_rate_shifted,
            'New_Rate_Shifted': new_rate_shifted, 'NPV_orig_Shifted': npv_orig_shifted,
            'NPV_new_Shifted': npv_new_shifted, 'Delta_NPV_Shifted': delta_npv_shifted
        })
    return pd.DataFrame(sensitivity_results)
```

**Streamlit Interaction:**
1.  Ensure you have generated loan data from the "Data Generation" page first.
2.  On the "NPV Analysis" page, set the **"Rate Shift (Basis Points)"**. This allows you to simulate changes in market interest rates or perceived risk.
3.  Click the **"Run Sensitivity Analysis"** button.
4.  The results will be displayed in a DataFrame under **"Sensitivity Analysis Results (shifted rates)"**.

## 4. Visualizing Economic Impact
Duration: 0:15

Visualizations are crucial for understanding complex financial data and communicating insights effectively. This step demonstrates how the calculated cash flows and NPV results are transformed into interactive plots using Plotly.

### Navigating to the Page

In the Streamlit sidebar, select **"Visualizations"** from the **Navigation** dropdown.

<aside class="negative">
Before proceeding, ensure you have completed the "Data Generation" step (Page 1) and the "NPV Analysis" step (Page 2). The visualizations on this page rely on the data generated and calculated in the previous steps.
</aside>

### Cash Flow Timeline

The Cash Flow Timeline visualization provides a clear representation of the payment streams for both the original and new loan scenarios. This allows for a direct comparison of how restructuring alters the timing and magnitude of cash inflows.

*   **X-axis:** Represents the `date` of the payments.
*   **Y-axis:** Shows the `Total Payment Amount` (principal + interest).
*   **Blue Line:** Represents the `Original Cash Flow` schedule.
*   **Red Line:** Represents the `New Cash Flow` schedule.

This chart is invaluable for understanding the operational impact of restructuring, such as extended terms or changes in periodic payments.

**Code Snippet (`application_pages/plots.py`):**
```python
def plot_improved_cashflow_timeline_streamlit(df_long):
    """
    Plots the cash flow timeline for original and new scenarios using Plotly.
    df_long is expected to have 'loan_id', 'date', 'total_payment', and 'scenario' columns.
    """
    if df_long.empty:
        # ... (empty plot handling)
    
    fig = go.Figure()
    df_orig = df_long[df_long['scenario'] == 'Original']
    df_new = df_long[df_long['scenario'] == 'New']
    
    if not df_orig.empty:
        fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=df_orig['date'], y=df_orig['total_payment'], mode='lines', name='Original Cash Flow', line=dict(color='blue', width=2)))
    if not df_new.empty:
        fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=df_new['date'], y=df_new['total_payment'], mode='lines', name='New Cash Flow', line=dict(color='red', width=2)))
    # ... (layout updates)
    return fig
```

**Streamlit Interaction:**
1.  Under **"Cash Flow Timeline"**, you can select a specific **"Loan ID for Detailed Cash Flow Timeline"** from the dropdown or choose "All Loans" to see an aggregated view (though individual loans are more informative here).
2.  The plot will dynamically update to show the cash flow comparison.

### $\Delta$NPV Waterfall Chart

The $\Delta$NPV Waterfall Chart is an exceptionally powerful visualization for summarizing the aggregate economic impact of restructuring across the entire portfolio. It visually represents the bridge from the total original NPV to the total new NPV, highlighting gains and losses along the way.

*   It calculates the aggregate `NPV_orig`, `NPV_new`, and the total `Delta_NPV` for the entire portfolio.
*   `Gains`: The sum of positive $\Delta NPV$ values from individual loans.
*   `Losses`: The sum of negative $\Delta NPV$ values from individual loans.

This chart provides a quick, high-level overview of whether the restructuring initiative, as a whole, is economically beneficial or detrimental.

**Code Snippet (`application_pages/plots.py`):**
```python
def plot_improved_waterfall_chart_streamlit(results_df):
    """
    Plots a waterfall chart of NPV components using Plotly.
    results_df is expected to have 'NPV_orig', 'NPV_new', 'Delta_NPV' columns.
    """
    if results_df.empty:
        # ... (empty plot handling)

    total_original_npv = results_df['NPV_orig'].sum()
    total_new_npv = results_df['NPV_new'].sum()
    total_delta_npv = results_df['Delta_NPV'].sum()
    gains = results_df[results_df['Delta_NPV'] > 0]['Delta_NPV'].sum()
    losses = results_df[results_df['Delta_NPV'] < 0]['Delta_NPV'].sum()

    data = dict(
        measure=['absolute', 'relative', 'relative', 'absolute', 'total'],
        x=['Total Original NPV', 'Gains', 'Losses', 'Total New NPV', 'Total \u0394NPV'],
        y=[total_original_npv, gains, losses, total_new_npv, total_delta_npv],
        text=[f'${total_original_npv:,.2f}', f'${gains:,.2f}', f'${losses:,.2f}', f'${total_new_npv:,.2f}', f'${total_delta_npv:,.2f}'],
        # ... (textposition, connector)
    )
    fig = go.Figure(go.Waterfall(data))
    # ... (layout updates)
    return fig
```

**Streamlit Interaction:**
1.  Below the Cash Flow Timeline, you will see the **"$\Delta$NPV Waterfall Chart"**. This chart is automatically generated once NPV analysis results are available in the session state.

### Comprehensive Loan Portfolio Analysis

This multi-faceted visualization provides a deeper, loan-level view of the restructuring impact across the portfolio. It combines four distinct plots to offer a holistic understanding:

1.  **Individual Loan Impact ($\Delta NPV$):** A bar chart showing the $\Delta NPV$ for each individual loan. This quickly highlights which loans experienced significant gains or losses.
2.  **Materiality Distribution (Pie Chart):** Shows the proportion of loans that are "material" (i.e., whose $\Delta NPV$ exceeds the defined materiality threshold) versus "non-material."
3.  **Total $\Delta NPV$ by Loan Type (Bar Chart):** Aggregates the $\Delta NPV$ by loan type (e.g., Mortgage, Auto, Personal), helping identify which loan categories are most affected by restructuring.
4.  **$\Delta NPV$ vs. Original Loan Amount (Scatter Plot):** Plots the $\Delta NPV$ against the original loan amount, allowing analysts to observe if there's a correlation between loan size and the economic impact of restructuring. The points are color-coded by their $\Delta NPV$ value.

**Code Snippet (`application_pages/plots.py`):**
```python
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots

def plot_loan_level_analysis_streamlit(npv_results_df, df_loans):
    """
    Plots a comprehensive multi-plot visualization for loan-level analysis using Plotly.
    Combines bar chart for individual loan impact, pie chart for materiality distribution,
    bar chart for impact by loan type, and scatter plot for impact vs. loan size.
    """
    if npv_results_df.empty or df_loans.empty:
        # ... (empty plot handling)
    
    merged_df = npv_results_df.merge(df_loans[['loan_id', 'loan_type', 'original_amount']], on='loan_id', how='left')
    merged_df['material_flag_str'] = merged_df['material'].apply(lambda x: 'Material' if x else 'Non-Material')

    fig = make_subplots(rows=2, cols=2,
                        subplot_titles=('Individual Loan Impact (\u0394NPV)',
                                          'Materiality Distribution',
                                          'Total \u0394NPV by Loan Type',
                                          '\u0394NPV vs. Original Loan Amount'),
                        specs=[[{}, {'type':'domain'}], [{}, {}]])

    # Add traces to the subplots (omitted for brevity, but includes Bar, Pie, Scatter)
    # ...
    fig.update_layout(height=700, showlegend=True, template="plotly_white", title_text="Comprehensive Loan Portfolio Analysis")
    return fig
```

**Streamlit Interaction:**
1.  Below the Waterfall Chart, you will find the **"Comprehensive Loan Portfolio Analysis"** plot, which combines the four sub-charts. This chart is also automatically generated if NPV analysis results are available.

These visualizations provide a powerful set of tools for financial analysts to understand the complex economic implications of loan restructuring at both an aggregate portfolio level and a granular loan level.

## 5. Conclusion and Further Exploration
Duration: 0:03

Congratulations! You have successfully navigated through the Streamlit application for analyzing loan restructuring impact using NPV models.

### Key Takeaways

Throughout this codelab, you have:

*   **Understood the Business Value:** Appreciated why accurately assessing loan restructuring impact is crucial for financial institutions in terms of risk management, strategic decision-making, and regulatory compliance.
*   **Generated Synthetic Data:** Learned how to create realistic, controlled datasets for financial modeling, including both original and restructured loan terms.
*   **Developed a Discounted Cash Flow Engine:** Gained insight into the implementation of a deterministic discounted cash flow engine to compute `NPV_orig`, `NPV_new`, and the critical `Delta_NPV` for individual loans.
*   **Interpreted Results Visually:** Explored how interactive visualizations like cash flow timelines, waterfall charts, and comprehensive loan-level analyses can provide deep insights into economic gains or losses from restructuring.
*   **Performed Sensitivity Analysis:** Understood the importance of stress-testing financial models by evaluating the impact of changes in discount rates on NPV outcomes.
*   **Applied Streamlit Best Practices:** Observed the use of `st.session_state` for data persistence and `st.cache_data` for performance optimization, key aspects of building robust Streamlit applications.

### Potential Extensions and Further Exploration

This application provides a solid foundation, but financial modeling is an ever-evolving field. Here are some ideas for further exploration and enhancement:

1.  **More Sophisticated Discount Rates:**
    *   Incorporate dynamic yield curves (e.g., U.S. Treasury rates) to derive the risk-free rate component.
    *   Implement more granular credit spread models that account for loan-specific risk factors, industry, and macroeconomic conditions.
    *   Consider different types of discount rates for various cash flow streams (e.g., funding costs, required returns).

2.  **Scenario Analysis:**
    *   Allow users to define custom economic scenarios (e.g., recession, recovery) that impact interest rates, credit spreads, and potentially default probabilities.
    *   Integrate probability-weighted average outcomes for expected NPV.

3.  **Default and Prepayment Modeling:**
    *   Introduce models for loan default probabilities and expected loss given default, incorporating these into the cash flow projections.
    *   Include prepayment assumptions (e.g., based on interest rate changes or borrower behavior) that might alter cash flow timing.

4.  **Optimization Framework:**
    *   Develop an optimization module that suggests optimal restructuring terms (e.g., new rate, new term) to maximize $\Delta NPV$ subject to certain constraints (e.g., borrower affordability).

5.  **User Management and Audit Trails:**
    *   For production-grade applications, add user authentication, role-based access control, and comprehensive audit trails for data generation and analysis runs.

6.  **Integration with Real-world Data:**
    *   Modify the data ingestion part to connect to actual loan data databases or APIs.

We hope this codelab has provided you with a comprehensive understanding of how to analyze loan restructuring impact using NPV models within an interactive Streamlit application. The principles and techniques demonstrated here are broadly applicable to various areas of financial analysis and quantitative finance.
